# Base Class: Person 
Data members: name and age of type string <br>
Member function: display() method that displays the name and age of an object created via the Person class <br>

# Child Class: Student
which inherits from the Person class <br>
Data members: student_name, student_age and student_section of type string <br>
Member function: displayStudent() that displays the student_name, student_age and student_section of an object created via the Student class <br>

# python super() 
The super() builtin returns a proxy object (temporary object of the superclass) that allows us to access methods of the base class <br>

In Python, super() has two major use cases: <br>
1. Allows us to avoid using the base class name explicitly <br>
2. Working with Multiple Inheritance
